            <p> <p>Within the OER movement the Wikiversity was found in 2006 and the first open course on the platform was organised in 2007.
                    Tenâ€“week course with than more than 70 students was used to test the idea of making Wikiversity an open and free platform
                     for education in the tradition of Scandinavian free adult education, Folk High School and the free school movement.[17] 
                     The term MOOC was coined in 2008 by Dave Cormier of the University of Prince Edward Island in response to a course called
                      Connectivism and Connective Knowledge (also known as CCK08). CCK08, which was led by George Siemens of Athabasca University 
                      and Stephen Downes of the National Research Council, consisted of 25 tuition-paying students in Extended Education at the 
                      University of Manitoba, as well as over 2200 online students from the general public who paid nothing.[18] All course 
                      content was available through RSS feeds, and online students could participate through collaborative tools, including
                       blog posts, threaded discussions in Moodle, and Second Life meetings.[19][20][21] Stephen Downes considers these so-called 
                       cMOOCs to be more "creative and dynamic" than the current xMOOCs, which he believes "resemble television shows or digital
                        textbooks."[18]
